We want to build a YouTube thumbnail maker app.

Key features:

- Support background image (color or subtle patterns)
- Add text element (font, color, size, placement, multiple texts)
- Add photo element (upload photo, mask out human face)
- Support drag-and-drop editing elements (move, rotate, scale)
- Download as jpg or png (must match YouTube thumbnail guidelines)

Technical considerations:

- No database, no user management, just a simple web app
- Preferrably based on HTML canvas
- Probably no framework needed, just vanillaJS and jQuery

Optional features:

- AI-based image rating system to check for viral potential
