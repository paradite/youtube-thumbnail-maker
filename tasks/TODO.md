## TODO

Task 1: Add support for svg image upload and editing.

Task 2: Add outline (border) to images (including human mask)

```
Add a feature to allow the user to add outline or border to images. This should work both the regular images and the images of people which have segmented out by the human segmentation feature. For images of people that has been segmented out, the outline should be added around the person, instead of the whole image.
```

Task 3: Improve cropping feature (directly manipulate the crop area on the canvas)

Task 4: Add more fine-grained control for parameters in Person Segmentation feature.
